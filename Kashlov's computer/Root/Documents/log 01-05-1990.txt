Will there be more guardians in the state than carpenters, smiths etc [workers]? Won’t the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who have some knowledge? The guardians will bring wisdom to the state, and thus the state will be both wise and ‘constituted according to nature’ [i.e. to run a state on the basis of guidance by a class who have wisdom - knowledge of the whole state - is the ‘natural’ way to run a state].

 

How do we decide if a state is brave? We consider that part of the state that fights and goes to war on the state’s behalf - i.e. soldiers. The rest of the citizens may be courageous or cowardly, but this will not make the state itself brave or cowardly. The kind of knowledge that courage is based on is knowledge of what things should be feared or not. [Note Plato adds here: ‘as our legislator has educated them – he believed that states were most likely to be set up, or established, by a ‘legislator’ – one who drew up the original rules/laws/constitution.]

 

Soldiers need training so that they understand and will obey the laws of the land, as well as being aware of dangers to the state. Then they will have the courage that the state requires – and this will be different from ‘mere uninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or slave.’ They will have the courage ‘of a citizen’ – i.e. someone who considers, and acts on the interests of, the state (not someone being courageous on their own behalf).
